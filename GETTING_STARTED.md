# Sakthi Solar Systems — 3D Website

- Next.js 14 + TS + Tailwind + Framer Motion
- 3D tilt, parallax-style hero, lots of image placeholders
- Brand colours loaded from **/public/brand.json** (edit to match your logo)

## Run
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Change brand colours
Edit **public/brand.json** (hex codes). The site reads them at runtime and updates CSS variables.

## Logo
Your uploaded logo is saved at **/public/brand/logo.pdf** (also keep **/public/logo.svg** as a fallback for the header). For best results, upload a PNG/SVG later.

## Deploy
Push to GitHub → Vercel → Deploy.
